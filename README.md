Intrinsic definition of meanders in Agda. The result of discussions on Discord in the winter of 2022/2023.

I speculated that the combinatorics of meanders should be related to Lambert's W function because meanders arise as the string diagrammatics of the equation "T = Set^T", but didn't in the end find any real evidence for this. (W does [count rooted trees](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lambert+W-function#counting_rooted_trees) though.)
